# ECManager
Simple console aplication that can compress and encrypt files.

In future i plan to add boost library and more complicated compression/encryption algorithms.

currently existing commands: 
help                         --- lists commands

ECHuffman [-e][-d] <file>    --- compress[-e] or decompress[-d] <file> using Huffman encoding

ECCaesar [-e][-d] <file>     --- encrypt[-e] or decrypt[-d] <file> using Caesar cipher

exit                         --- exits program
